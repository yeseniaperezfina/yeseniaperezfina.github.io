            <p>
              I lead with a bias toward clarity, coherence, and care. My first move in any complex
              environment is to make the landscape legible: who is here, what matters to them, what
              the system is asking for, and where the friction lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              From there, I design structures and stories that people can actually move through:
              portfolios that align scattered efforts, convenings that surface what’s unsaid, and
              narratives that connect mission to daily decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m most alive in work that sits at the intersection of strategy and humanity—where
              rigorous thinking, creative insight, and relational leadership are all required for the
              system to hold.
