              <strong>large-scale learning initiatives, portfolios, and environments</strong>
              at the intersection of higher education, philanthropy, science &amp; society, and equitable design.

            <p>I’m especially interested in:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>Program Officer / Director roles in philanthropy &amp; higher-ed innovation</li>
              <li>Higher education or learning environment strategist roles in design firms</li>
              <li>Science &amp; society / STEM equity leadership roles in mission-driven organizations</li>
