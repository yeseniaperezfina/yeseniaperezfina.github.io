## About Me

I design and steward **learning ecosystems** that connect people to knowledge, opportunity, and a sense of belonging.

Over the past seven years, I’ve led **national, research-driven initiatives for NASA’s Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)**, collaborating with universities, MSIs, museums, libraries, and community organizations across the U.S. I am also an **Ed.M. candidate in Education Leadership at the Harvard Graduate School of Education**.

My work lives where:

- **Higher education strategy & planning**
- **STEM and public science engagement**
- **Learning environments & experience design**
- **Justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (J.E.D.I.)**

all overlap.
